Background
	Probability distribution fitting is the fitting of a probability distribution to a series of data concerning the repeated measurement of a variable phenomenon. The theoretical distribution giving a close fit can then be used for various purposes as described in use-cases.

	An approach to fit a probability distribution to data is a goodness of fit test. This compares the observed frequency (f) to the expected frequency from the model (f-hat) for any number of classes. In ``distfit`` we computed the goodness of fit test with the sum of squared errors (or estimates) (SSE), also named residual sum of squares (RSS). 

	The *RSS* describes the deviation predicted from actual empirical values of data. Or in other words, the differences in the estimates. It is a measure of the discrepancy between the data and an estimation model. A small RSS indicates a tight fit of the model to the data. RSS is computed by:

	Where **yi** is the ith value of the variable to be predicted, **xi** is the i-th value of the explanatory variable, and **f(xi)** is the predicted value of **yi** (also termed **y-hat**).

	In the ``distfit`` library, we compute the RSS for 89 theoretical distributions. The best fitted theoretical distribution is returned with the loc, scale, arg parameters which can then be used to compute the probability on new data-points.

Use-cases
	The ``distfit`` function has many use-cases, it can, first of all, be used to determine the best theoretical distribution for your data. This can reduce tens-of-thousands of data points into 3 floating parameters. Another application is the usage for outlier detection. A null-distribution can be determined using the **normal** state. New datapoints that deviate significantly from those can be marked as outliers, and potential of interest. The null-distribution can also be generated by randomization/permuation approaches. In such case, the new datapoints will be marked if it significantly deviates from randomness.
