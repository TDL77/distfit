distfit's documentation!
========================

``distfit`` is python package for probability density functions of univariate distributions on non-censored data by residual sum of squares (RSS). ``distfit`` determines the best fit across 89 theoretical distributions. The best fitted theoretical distribution is returned with the loc, scale, arg parameters. New data-points can then be assed for significance on the detected distribution.
